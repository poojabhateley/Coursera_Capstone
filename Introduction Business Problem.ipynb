    "##### Foursquare is a trusted Locaion Data platform which is easily accessible for a variety of applications. One such application is a mobile app which uses location data to help users find neighbourhoods where they can think about living. In a case wherein a family needs to move to a new location, and they are in love with the present neighborhood and all the amenities attached with it, they would prefer a neighborhood with the same type of feature and amenities. The basis of building such application would be the location data from Foursquare which can be used as a starting point to define the different services and benefits in the present neighbood, and finally by using Clustering ML algorithm, they can find the similar neighborhood for seraching houses."
